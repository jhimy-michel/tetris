 # TETRIS 🕹️

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

> This project was based on a youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGOaCxX8HIU&t=3057s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org
> I made some updates on top of it like using typescript, adding linters, tests, etc.
